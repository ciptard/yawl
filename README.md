YAWL Ain't Web Logs
===================

YAWL is a very simple blogging platform. It has the following features:
* YAWL reads a directory of JIFF files, then generates a recent file and an archive file (both in JSON). The recent and archive files are rendered as indices to blog posts.
* YAWL uses JIFF as the file format for posts.


Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backwards compatibility, this code will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
