  The dory is a small, shallow-draft boat, about 5 to 7 metres/16.4 to 23.0 feet long. 
  It is a lightweight and versatile boat with high sides, a flat bottom and sharp bows. 
  They are easy to build because of their simple lines. 
  For centuries, dories have been used as traditional fishing boats, 
  both in coastal waters and in the open sea. 
  Variant spellings are doree and dori.
